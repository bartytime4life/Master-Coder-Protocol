# BIO-PROT-001: Plasmid Miniprep SOP

## Purpose
Isolate plasmid DNA from cultured cells.

## Scope
BSL-1 laboratory.

## Responsibilities
Technicians follow steps; supervisor reviews results.

## Safety/Compliance
Wear gloves and goggles. Dispose waste per local regulations.

## Materials
- Resuspension buffer
- Lysis buffer
- Neutralization buffer

## Procedure
1. Harvest 5 mL overnight culture.
2. Resuspend pellet in 250 µL buffer.
3. Lyse with 250 µL lysis buffer; invert.
4. Neutralize with 350 µL buffer; invert.
5. Spin and clean up using columns.

## Quality Control/Acceptance Criteria
Expect 100–200 ng/µL, A260/280 between 1.8–2.0.

## Deviations/Nonconformances
Record sample IDs and deviations here.

## Records/Traceability
