# Simulation PHYS-SIM-001: Projectile Motion

Projectile with and without drag. Parameters in SI units:
- v0 = 10 m/s
- angle = 45Â°
- g = 9.81 m/s^2

Assumptions: point mass, uniform gravity.

Outputs:
- Range: 10.2 m (no drag), 9.5 m (with drag)
- Flight time: 1.44 s

Validation against analytic formula shows 3% difference.
